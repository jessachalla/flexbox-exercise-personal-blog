            <p>Hi! I am a student at Grand Circus. I have many interests including learning new things, art, and being outside. Outside of this class, I am a GIS Technician at REGIS. We work to continually improve one of the nation's largest multi-participant GIS programs.</p>
            <p>As part of the REGIS Agency staff, I help maintain a common database and suite of applications and interfaces to satisfy the spatial data management needs of all participant members. Members include surrounding cities, townships, and government agencies.</p>
            <p>By participating in REGIS and working together as a team, member communities will be able to share valuable information, provide better and more consistent service to constituents, and reduce operating costs. Our alliance of governmental units promote growth and development, improve the quality of the community's life, and coordinate governmental services. </p>
            <p>I am most passionate about applying GIS to efficiently analyze geographic information to solve problems. I am internally motivation, attentive, and goal oriented. These skills allow me to do detailed work. I readily volunteer for new assignments and challenges. I approach tasks with the appropriate amount of preparation, and apply my knowledge and ethics to produce quality work. Above all, I am self-assured and confident about my potential.</p>
